**TYPES OF EXOPLANETS**

>GAS GIANTS

Gas giants are planets the size of Saturn or Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, or much, much larger.
More variety is hidden within these broad categories. Hot Jupiters, for instance, were among the first planet types found â€“ gas giants orbiting so closely to their stars that their temperatures soar into the thousands of degrees (Fahrenheit or Celsius).
